# C++ Problem Solutions – Programming Advices | CPP Part 4 (Course 8)

This repository contains solutions to **65 practical programming problems** written in **C++**, provided by the **Programming Advices** platform.

These problems are part of **CPP – Part 4 (Course 8)** and focus on **enhancing problem-solving skills**, **reusing previously implemented functions**, and building more **organized and efficient C++ programs**.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each problem is solved in a **separate `.cpp` file** for clarity and organization.
- Some problems are accompanied by **illustrative images** (available in the *Problems Images* folder if included).
- The solutions emphasize:
  - Reusing previously built **functions**
  - Clean and readable code
  - Proper naming conventions
  - Logical structure and modular thinking
  - Reducing code duplication through function utilization

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Solve more advanced **real-world programming problems**
- Practice **function reuse** and modular programming
- Strengthen understanding of **C++ fundamentals**
- Apply **Clean Code principles**
- Improve logical thinking and structured problem analysis

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Development Environment
For the best development and testing experience, it is recommended to use:
- **Visual Studio (Windows)**

However, the code can be compiled using any standard C++ compiler that supports modern C++ standards.
